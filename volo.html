            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <div>
The name Jur is a descriptive word in Dinka language which means people who
stayed far and did not speak Dinka local language and did not practice their local cultural activities. 
The Jur area extends from Bahr Gel, North of Cueibet, to Wulu and then extended in the borderline from 
Rumbek and Yirol in Lakes State at the North-west, and from Tali in Central Equatoria State and from 
Amadi in Mundri East, Mundri West, and Maridi County in Western Equatoria state. The estimated area and 
the map of Jur area is not shown in this website due to some technical problem which will be rectify and
will be included in the next update.People in Jur area mostly are agriculturist and few others owned cattle,
 goats and sheep.The Jur language belongs to Baka and Bongo and it was belief that Jur people were related group to
Baka and Bongo in their company. Jur people like hunting in group as the line up in process of burning 
the bush and wait in secrete ambush to hunting the animals that may run out from the fire and smoking.

Jur people are loyal to each other and were very committed and respected to their cultures and their spirit of dead
 (marinyi). The Jur people were divided in to two different regions with Jur Beli at Wulu under the administration 
of Bahr el Ghazal Region while Jur at Mvolo site were placed under the administration of Equatoria region. 
The division was done during the time of British colonized in Sudan and in accordance with the border demarcation of 
1956 of Sudan independent. It was not known or make clear as why one tribe was divided like that, different ideology from 
the local analysts were that, it is because Jur are very strong agriculturist that is why they were divided into those
 two regions as to balance the food production to the idlers while others went further by said that the division was
  political planned to let Jur people remain scattered without having one objective for their future. However, this website 
  is only focus on Jur at Mvolo area which have more than seven sub tribes which I belief to includes Modo, Lori, Wira, 
Sopi, Nyamosa, Moro-Kondo, 'Beli who are found at both sites of Mvolo and Wulu, Wetu and Molo.

promote health of the family members, some of these gods owned by individual are Ya‟da, Barijoko effluence from Dinka,
 Kaga influence from Azander and Sari 'ba Ala that means to earn enough harvesting and availability of food at all family
